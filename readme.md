# General Purpose Grid Editor

GPGP is a minimal, general purpose 2D tile-based level editor for LÖVE. It uses Lua files for setup, and it exports levels as Lua files, which makes it easy to use the data for any LÖVE game. And since it's made with LÖVE (and the code base is pretty small), hopefully it'll be pretty easy to customize to your liking.

This is very early in development, so please help me improve this! My goal is to make this program as easy to hack as possible so people can customize it for the specific needs of each game, but I'm sure there's things that can be done to make hacking this more accessible. So yeah, help me out!

Also, take a look at the wiki for an overview of the code.
